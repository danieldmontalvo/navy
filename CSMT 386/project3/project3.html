	    <h2>Explain the importance of reponsive desgin and its impact on that target audience.</h2>
	    <p>Responsive design is very important to implement. Once someone puts together a website, it automatically scales its content and elements to match the screen size on which it is viewed. This keeps images from being larger than the screen width, and it can prevent visitors on mobile devices from needing to do extra work to read content from the webpage. This helps target audience readability since in 2021 most common webpages are viewed in mobile or tablet format. If a webpage's content did not integrate responsive design, the target audience may be lost. You want to ensure readable text without zooming, no horizontal scrolling, and adequate space around links and buttons to tap any targets.</p>
          <p> Using CSS is the method to impropriate a flexible website regardless of screen size. If you would like to experience this, please make this webpage screen small and make it full screen. You will see how the website responds to ensure the best readability and usability. </p>

	    <h2>Google Analytics provides a wealth of data for free to help assess the success of websites. Describe three different kinds of reports that will tell you what information your target audience is accessing</h2>
	    <h5>The three Google Analytics reports I will discuss are:</h5>
	    <p> <b>Audience Overview:</b>  If you want an overview of web traffic this is the report you want to look at. Creating an Audience Segment will allow you to narrow a certain range of web traffic to get a better insight. Lastly, looking at other periods one can see if an increase or decrease in traffic has occurred. 
	    <br><br><b>Landing pages:</b> land page reports can show what pages the site users are interacting with most. This will give insight such as new users, bounce rate, and how many new sessions/ clicks you have. This will help see what our target audience is accessing and which one is bouncing. 
	    <br><br> <b>Site content:</b> 
	    When viewing the Site content report in Google Analytics, this is very helpful when you would want to see line items such as Pageviews, average time on a page. This will identify the content that is catching the audience's attention.
